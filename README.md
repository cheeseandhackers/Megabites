# About the Project: 

Modern day science emphasizes the great importance of healthy and fulfilling interactions with food. Our quality of life and mental health is dependent upon on the daily food choices we make. Here at MegaBites we wish to empower you to make the choices that are right for you. We wanted to create an app where you can search recipes consistent with the top 4 diets backed by science and save any recipe you like to your own user recipe dashboard.
